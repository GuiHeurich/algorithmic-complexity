## Algorithmic Complexity Timer

As part of a workshop led by Alice for Makers Academy Alumni, this programs prints out the time it takes to run a few ruby functions. The objective is a learning one, to understand how algorithms perform when you scale their complexity.

My timer is now up Heroku, please visit:

# Instructions

Clone the repo, run `bundle install` and then `ruby app.rb`, and then open `localhost:4567`.
